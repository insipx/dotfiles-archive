2016-10-10 10:30:44	spacebyte	hey guys, I'm using a fresh install of Manjaro with kernel version 4.4.22-1, and I'm having a reaaally weird bug. Everytime I click Alt+<arrow> or Alt+<Function key> my display freezes. In order for it to "go back alive" I need click to click ctrl-alt-f7. I've tried the latest kernel, but it still happens. Any idea what it might be?

2016-10-10 11:25:46	ArgyroNet	I got a little question if anyone ever faced this problem: someone in my family wants a FB page for his children, for sharing their pictures with his wife (they don't live together). As it seems that FB isn't a good idea at all, we are seeking for a better alternative
